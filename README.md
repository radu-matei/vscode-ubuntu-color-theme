### Notes

- the color scheme was initially generated using [the VS Code theme
  generator][theme-generator], and later manually tweaked by preference.
- this theme does _not_ follow any best practices around optimal contrast for
  color schemes.
- a similar color scheme for your Windows Terminal [can be found
  here][win-terminal-theme].
- a similar color scheme for iTerm2 [can be found here][iterm2-theme].
